# ESP8266_EnhancedSensorPlatform
<strong>A Project on developing an Enhanced Sensor Platform that can be mounted onto the Pololu 3pi Robot.</strong> 

<strong>The code is written in Arduino IDE.</strong>

Refer to: Server_esr_v1.23 (for the development of a web server on the ESP8266 MCU)

Refer to: enhancedsensor_thingspeak_v1.9 (to send and receive data from ThingSpeak using the ESP8266 MCU)

<strong>The schematics and board layout were developed on DipTrace.</strong>
<br><br>Robot_Sensor_v1.1 (Schematic design for the Proximity sensor modular unit)
<br>Robot_v2.4(MarkIII) (Schematic design for the finalised prototype of the enhanced sensor platform)

sensor_pcb_v1.3 (n_markIII) (Board design for the Proximmity sensor modular unit)
<br>robot_pcb_v2.4(markIII) (Board design for the finalised prototype of the enhanced sensor platform)</br>
